# ESM Formative Assignment: Group Presentation

## DEMONSTRATOR MARKING

| Group   | Strengths | Areas for Improvement | Overall (using marking criteria) | Mark (out of 20) |
|---------|------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Group 5 |clear question and goo independant thinking of the experiment desigh; good sensitivity studies to cover the uncertainties of cGENIE;            |reading rather than speaking; inconsistent citation and more citation could be added; explored too many questions while a lack of thinking in depth;                       |       very good understanding and knowledge                          |          14        |
| Group 1 |good readings, analytical depth within the framework; rather independent thought based on what has been taught; good intepretation of results and acceptable conclusions           | formating of slides is not proper; inconsistent citations; lack attention to detailed mechanism driving the hysteresis differences;                     |             good understanding and knowledge                    |         13         |
| Group 2 |clear experiment design; good knowledge of model uncertainty and limitations; strong point supported by proper analytic framework and arguments; A range o methods and techniques to come to credible and considered conclusion           | reading rather than speaking; though some confident illustration is shown;                     |             very good understanding with good application                    |       14           |
| Group 3 |clear experiment designs; attempts independent thought, with some effort to engage material beyond the bounds of what has generally been taught, though thoughts lack in depth;            |inconsistent citations and more citations should be added; lack key formation to explain the mechanism;                      |            good understanding and good application                     |       13           |
| Group 4 |good delivery of contents; limited attempts at independent thought, with some effort to engage material beyond the bound of what has been taught. Generally supported by evidence which is not fully critically evaluated; Able to use a range of methods and techniques beyond what has been taught;           |lack citations; formating of slides need improvement; lacking a considered richness in conceptual depth                      |      generally good understanding and knowledge                           |      12            |
